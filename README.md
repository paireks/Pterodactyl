## Purpose

Pterodactyl is an open-source plug-in for Grasshopper (Rhino 7) created for the purpose of generating custom documents, reports, articles, etc. that can be updated in real time. 

## How it works?

Pterodactyl sends data (saves it locally) as .md, which is Markdown filename extension. To open it or to save it as pdf, html, docx or LaTeX, you need Typora or other Markdown editor. You can download it [here](https://typora.io/).

Basically it works like this:
